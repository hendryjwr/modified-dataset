# modified-dataset

This repository contains 640x640 images, modified from https://github.com/cv-core/MIT-Driverless-CV-TrainingInfra, and the modified annotations to provide training for coloured-cone detection.

There are also pretrained weights for the detection of yellow, blue and other (orange/green) cones.
